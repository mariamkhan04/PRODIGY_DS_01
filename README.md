# **Exploring Data Distributions: An Analysis of User Behavior**

## **Project Overview**
This project visualizes the distribution of categorical and continuous variables, such as **age**, **gender**, and **app usage**, using **bar charts and histograms**. The aim is to analyze user behavior patterns and extract actionable insights, as part of **Task 1** during my internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.

## **Project Task**
The main task of this project was:
- **Create a bar chart or histogram** to visualize the distribution of a **categorical or continuous variable**, such as the **distribution of ages or genders** in a population.

## **Dataset**
The dataset includes information on **1,000 mobile users** and covers several attributes/variables:
- **User ID**
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **Total App Usage Hours**
- **Daily Screen time Hours**
- **Number of Apps Used**
- **Social Media Usage Hours**
- **Productivity App Usage Hours**
- **Gaming App Usage Hours**
- **Location**

## **Files in this Repository**
1. **main.ipynb**  
   - Contains the core analysis, including **visualizations** for various user-related data.
   - Provides **short insights** under each plot for an overview of findings.

2. **insights_report.ipynb**  
   - Contains **detailed insights** for each plot.
   - **Screenshots of the plots** are included beneath the detailed insights.

3. **README.md**  
   - Provides an overview of the project, task, and file structure.

4. **mobile_usage_behavioral_analysis.csv**
   - The dataset contains **1000 mobile users** and **10 attributes**. It was sourced from Kaggle.

## **How to Run the Project**
1. Clone this repository or download it as a zip file.
2. Install the necessary libraries by running:
    pip install pandas matplotlib 
3. Open and run the **main.ipynb** file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

## **Insights**
- **Short Insights**: A brief analysis of each distribution is included directly in the **main.ipynb** file.
- **Detailed Insights**: For more in-depth analysis, refer to the **insights_report.ipynb** file.

## **Key Visualizations**
- **User_ID Distribution**  
   The dataset shows a **uniform distribution** of user IDs across the range from 1 to 1000.

- **Age Distribution**  
   The dataset includes users aged between 18 and 59, with the highest frequency in the **20-29** age group.

- **Total App Usage Hours**  
   The daily app usage ranges from 1 to 12 hours, with an average of **6.4 hours**.

- **Additional Variables**  
   Insights into **daily screen time**, **number of apps used**, **social media usage**, **productivity app usage**, and **gaming app usage** are also explored in the project.

## **Conclusion**
The project successfully visualizes the distribution of various user-related variables, providing insights into user behavior patterns. The task offered practical experience in data visualization and analysis using **Python** and relevant libraries.
